  Consistency across attack types ensures that methodologies such as adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and instruction overrides align with the overall security goals of Large Language Models (LLMs). By maintaining a cohesive structure, all security measures can work synergistically to strengthen model integrity.

  Consistent practices make it easier to identify, test, and mitigate vulnerabilities, providing a unified approach to securing LLMs.

command: |
  # Example: Aligning Adversarial Attack Testing
  echo "Test model behavior against a crafted adversarial input." | python3 test_consistent_adversarial.py

  # Example: Unified Data Poisoning Assessment
  echo "Introduce poisoned data across workflows to test consistent defenses." | python3 test_consistent_poisoning.py

  # Example: Cohesive Instruction Override Tests
  echo "Attempt to override instructions consistently across different LLM deployments." | python3 test_consistent_override.py
