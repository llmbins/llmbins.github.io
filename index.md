LLMbins is an interactive cheat sheet, designed to support developers, security researchers, and AI practitioners working with large language models (LLMs). It contains a comprehensive list of tools, frameworks, and techniques for building, fine-tuning, deploying, and securing LLM-based applications.

If you hate constantly looking up the right command to use against a Windows or Active Directory environment (like me), this project should help ease the pain a bit. Just select what information you currently have related to the Windows machine (passwords, usernames, services, etc.), and it will display a list of tools you can try against the machine, along with a template command for easy copy/pasting. See the full list of [items](/items/) and [filters](/filters/).

This project was created by [Asif Nawaz Minhas](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/asifminhasnl) and was inspired by [GTFOBins][GTFOBins] and [LOLBAS][LOLBAS]. I relied heavily on [GTFOBins'][GTFOBins] site template to make this one.

I'm hoping to make LLMbins a [collaborative project][collaborative], so please feel free to [contribute][contribute] your commands.
